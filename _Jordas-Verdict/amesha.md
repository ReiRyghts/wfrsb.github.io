# Jordas Verdict - Archwing - Amesha

![Amesha](http://i.imgur.com/EdMM69r.png)

Your Archwing build in the Jordas Verdict will mark the difference between making the raid easy or constantly needing to be revived. For that purpose, Amesha is arguably the best choice, not only for new players but also for experienced raiders. This archwing doesnâ€™t just allow you to protect yourself and your team, but you will also be able to replenish yours and your squads health and energy.

Make no mistake - if there is such a thing as Archwing God-mode, Amesha is it.

## Role: CC, Bomb Carrier

## Build notes

* High Strength increase the number of drones in Watchful Swarm, letting you recast it less frequently. It also causes Benevolent Decoy to heal players at a higher rate and Warding Grace to slow down enemies even more.
* Duration is mostly handy for Benevolent Decoy and Vengeful Rush so they last for a longer time.
* Range is definitely needed for Benevolent Decoy so that it covers a wider area to protect and heal raiders.
* Efficiency isn't that important since you can use Vengeful Rush to recover energy. Increase it if you have the mod for it.

## Tactics

* Keep in mind that Vengeful Rush will make you immune to damage while you do not have full energy, so you can use it with Warding Grace to make yourself immortal.
* Alternatively you can active just Vengeful Rush and let enemies damage you. This way you can get a nice energy pool for later.
* It's a good idea to spam Watchful Swarm since it can be casted on yourself and your allies, and will help keep your team safe.
* When you see other raiders pushing the spore around and you're not occupied with any tasks, rush ahead of them and active Benevolent Decoy. This way you'll redirect any incoming fire towards the spore.
* If you cast the ability multiple times (up to three) in the same area, the bubble will stack, increasing it's time AND size.
* Be aware that Benevolent Decoy draws enemy fire into the center, so be cautious not to put Decoys in the direct path of the spore or it will simply get the spore shot many many times.
* Do NOT use Warding Grace (#3) when interacting with spores or fighting the Golem.
* Warding Grace not only slows down enemies, but also the infested spore that you need in order to progress. Slowing down the spore means slowing down progress!
* Do NOT use Warding Grace in the fight against the Golem, as it can cause him to glitch to the poin tof softlocking the raid and forcing you to start over.
