# Law of Retribution - Volt

![Volt](http://i.imgur.com/jByK7z8.png)

King of speed, Volt is a very versatile frame and widely used not only in normal runs but also speedruns. Not only can he make the raid go a lot faster, but his unique abilites allow him to buff his allies damage considerably and also CC the enemies, albeit not as effectively as Rhino or Vauban.

## Recommended build

The Arcane Storm and, to a lesser extent, Arcane Pulse helmets are a nice addition to this build but are by no means required.

## Budget build*

## Role: Support and, if you have Volt Prime, bomb carrier.

## Build notes

* Strength is the main stat here, as it increases the speed and (if you have Shock Trooper) damage buffs that your team will receive.
* A higher Range makes it easier to speed up the whole team in fewer casts.
* More Duration will make your buffs last longer, but is not as important as strength or range since all of them can be refreshed by casting them again.
* Primed Flow gives Volt Prime a huge energy pool, making him one of the best bomb carriers.

## Tactics

* Make sure that everyone in your team always has Speed, and don't be afraid to recast.
* Electric Shields can block any source of damage, including bomb explosions. When the bomb is getting ready to drop, cast one shield as flat on the ground as you can and then one shield at a 45 degree anglefrom the same position. This should keep everyone on the team safe from the bomb explosion.
* When on pads, you can cast shields around yourself to build a little safe house. Don't forget to electrocute them with Volt's 1 to stun enemies that rush you.
* Electric Shields can also boost the whole team's damage output, and can be stacked to kill Vay Hek more quickly.
* Discharge is useful as emergency CC, but can also kill enemies easily with high Strength. Make sure not to deprive your EV Trinity of targets.

## Alternative Builds

You can replace Rush with Shock Trooper to further boost your teammates' damage and help them kill priority targets or the final boss.
