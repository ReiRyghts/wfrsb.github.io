# Law of Retribution - Banshee

![Banshee](http://i.imgur.com/4RJZXB4.jpg)

Banshee's utility in raids is primarily to allow a team to kill Vay Hek instantly, with her Soundquake providing additional support throughout the mission. While she is outshined in terms of raw CC, she allows her team to save precious seconds if they are concerned with their time on a run.

## Role: Bomb Carrier, Damage Amp

## Build notes

* There can be a lot of versatility with Banshee builds for LoR
* The build needs to fulfill core requirements of 100+% power strength, cast speed, and high power pool
* The mods that are needed are as listed
* Natural Talent
* Quick Thinking
* Primed Flow (or regular if you don't have primed)
* Intensify/Blind Rage/Transient Fortitude (choose 1 or 2 based of the other 5 mods you choose.)
* Aura Mod (Preferably Corrosive Projection or Enemy Radar)
* For the other 5 mods you can choose based on how you like to play.
* Make sure Sonar lasts at least 5 seconds and has at least 15m range.
* Keep the core requirements in mind when making your build if you choose to make your own

## Tactics

* Soundquake is great hard CC, however you can easily kill enemies with this.
* The "Resonating Quake" augment for her 4th power is highly recommended.
* Use this skill only when you will not have to move for a short time, and be careful that you are not ignoring mission   objetives while quaking.
* Your main job comes at the very end of the raid as your team is destroying the last tower.
* During this part, position yourself within sonar range of Vay Hek and spam sonar.
* Sonar only applies after Vay Hek becomes vulnerable
* If your team is shooting the bomb to destroy towers, spam sonar when the bomb is 70%-80% charge
* If your team lets the bomb decay to destroy towers, spam sonar when the bomb has around 40%-50% of its charge left.
* Sonar stacks multiplicatively.
* Vay Hek should die as he touches the ground if you did everything right.

## Side-Notes 

* Banshee is somewhat difficult to play well, despite needing few mods, so I would recommend saving her for if/when you gain an interest in speedruns.
